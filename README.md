## ðŸ˜„ Who am I ?

I already wrote my name but I didn't get a chance to introduce myself yet...

I am currently a 3rd year student at EPITECH Bordeaux, in France. My school brought me alot to my programming skills, and as an involved person in technologies.
I'm curious about every programming paradigm however, I really enjoy a great project architecture over anything!

I'm a teacher assistant at EPITECH Bordeaux for 1st and 2nd year students. I follow their progress during their projects and introduce them to new units and notions ðŸ“šðŸ˜Š.

Projects that I really enjoyed and that are worth sharing in terms of architecture, usefulness, or interest will be added to my repositories on this profile! ðŸ”¥
